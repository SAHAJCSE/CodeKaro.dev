# Code-Karo.dev - Java Practice Judge

41 coding problems from Practice-Test 1-15 (the MCQs are not included), each with a starter file, a README, and test cases.
Only a JDK (Java 11+) is needed. Python 3 is used for the small runner, but you can also use plain `javac`.

## How to use

### Browser app

Start the local web app from this folder:

```powershell
py app.py
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) for the landing page, [http://127.0.0.1:8000/practice](http://127.0.0.1:8000/practice) for the judge, or [http://127.0.0.1:8000/profile](http://127.0.0.1:8000/profile) for your profile and submission heatmap. In the judge, choose a problem, edit `Solution.java`, then select **Run tests** (or press `Ctrl+Enter`). **Save** writes your current solution to that problem's folder. Keep the terminal open while using the app; press `Ctrl+C` there to stop it. If port 8000 is already in use, choose another, for example `py app.py --port 8080`.

The app uses only Python's standard library and your local JDK. It listens on your computer only; submitted code is compiled and run locally.

### Command line

```bash
python3 judge.py list                  # all problem ids
python3 judge.py pyramid-4             # runs problems/pyramid-4/Solution.java against its tests
python3 judge.py all                   # run every problem
python3 judge.py exam-topper --ref     # run the reference solution (to see what ACCEPTED looks like)
```
Without Python:
```bash
mkdir -p out && javac -d out common/Judge.java problems/exam-topper/*.java && java -cp out Test
```

Each problem folder: `Solution.java` (edit this - starter code with the exact signature), `README.md` (statement + samples), `Test.java` (the judge cases).
Output looks like:
```
=== Exam Topper ===
[PASS] sample 1
[FAIL] all negative
       Expected: -5
       Actual  : 0
Result: 4/6 passed  ->  WRONG ANSWER
```
Verdicts: PASS, FAIL (wrong answer, with Expected/Actual), Runtime Error (with the line), Time Limit Exceeded (2 s per case), Compilation Error.
Printing problems compare output line by line and ignore trailing spaces / blank lines.

## Notes on the starters
* Classes are package-private (`class Main`, not `public class Main`) because the file is named `Solution.java`; paste your code into the platform and add `public` if it needs it.
* Several statements were only partly visible in the photos. Where a rule was cut off, the assumption is in the problem README and tests avoid ambiguous cases
  (e.g. ties for the longest word, duplicate marks for second-highest, `n >= 10` in the digit pyramids).
